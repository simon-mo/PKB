Ernest Hemingway on Writing 

"Then there is the otehr secret. There isn't any symbolysm (mis-spelled)". The sea is the the sea. The old man is an old man. The boy is a boy and the fish is a fish. The shark are all sharks no better and no worse. All the symbolism that people say is shit. What goes beyond is what you see beyond when you know." to Bernard Berenson, 1952. 

In truly good writing no matter how many times you read it you do not know how it is done. That is because there is a mystery in all great writing and that mystery does not dissect out. It continues and it is always valid. Each time you re-read you see or learn something new.  - to Harvey Breit 1952. 

Good writing is true writing. If a man is making a story up it will be true in proportion to the amount of knowledge of life that he has and how conscientious he is; so that when he makes something up it is as it would truly be. - By-Line

Writing is a hard business Max but nothing makes you feel beter. - to Maxwell Perkins 1938. 

Writing is something that you can never do as well as it can be done. It is a perpetual challenge and it is more difficult than anything else that I have ever done— So I do it. And it makes me happy when I do it well. -to Ivan Kashkin 1935. 

There's no rule on how it is to write. Sometimes it comes easily and perfectly. Sometimes it is like drilling rock and then blasting it out with charges. -to Charles Poore 1953. 

The good parts of a book may be only something a writer is lucky enough to overhear or it may be the wreck of his whole damn life—and one is as good as the other. -to F. Scoot Fitzgerald. 1929

Dostoevsky was made by being sent to Siberia. Writers are forged in injsutice as a sword is forged. - Green Hills of Africa p71

civil war is the best war for a writer, the most complete. Stendhal had I seen a war and Napoleon taught him to write. He was teaching everybody then; but no one else learned. - Green Hills of Africa p71. 

The hardest thing in the world to do is to write stright honest prose on human beings. First you have to know the subject; then you have to know how to write. Both take a lifetime to learn… - By-line.

but the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or with luck and if you steted it purely enough, always, was beyond me and I was working very hard to get it. - Death in the Afternoon

How can a writer train himself? Watch what happens today…then get in somebody else's head for a change…Listen *now*. When people talk listen compeltely… There are thousands ways to practice. And always think fo other people. -By-line

[Ezra was]… the man who ahd taught me to distrust adjectives as I would alter learn to distrust certain people in certain situations… - A Moveable Feast. 

Mice: How much should you write a day? / Y.C.: The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know what will ahppen next. If you do that eveyr day when you are writing a novel you will never be stuck. That is the most valvuable thing I can tell you so try to remember it. / Mice: All right. / Y.C.: Always stop while you are going good and don't think about it or worry about it until you start to write the next day. That way your subconscious will work on it all the time. But if you think about it consciouly or worry about it you will kill it and your brain will be tired before you start. Once you are into the novel it is as cowardly to worry about whetehr you can go on the next day as to worry about having to go into inevitable aciton. You ahve to go on. So there is no sense to worry. You have to learn that to write a novel. The ahrd part about a novel is to finish it. /Mice: How can you learn not to worry? / Y.C.: By not thinking about it. As soon as you start to think about it stop it. Think about soemthing else. You have to learn that. -ByLine

The blue-backed notebooks, the two pencils and the pencil sharpener (a pocket knife was too wasteful), the marble0tpped talbes, the smell fo early morning, sweeping out and mopping, were all you need. - A Moveable Feast. 

You see it's awfully hard to talk or write about your own stuff because if it is any good you yourself know about how good it is-but if you say so yourself you feel like a shit. - to Malcolm Cowley.1945

Writing and travel broaden your ass if not your mind and I like to write standing up. - to Harvey Breit 1950.

Don't worry about the words. I've been doing that since 1921. I always count them when I knock off and am drinking the first whiskey and soda. Guess I got in the habit writing dispatches. Used to send them from some places where they cost a dollar and a quarter a word adn you had to make them awful interesting at that price or get fired. - to Charles Scribner 1940. 

Writing, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for writers palliate the writer's loneliness but I doubt if they improve his writing. he grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his wrok deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a good enough writer he must face eternity, ro the lack of it, each day. - Nobel Prize acceptance speech. 

I invented every word and every incident of A Farewell to Arms except possibly 3 or 4 incidents. All the best part is invented. 95 per cent of The Sun Also was pure imagination. I took real people in that one and I controlled what they did. I made it all up. -to Maxwell Perkins 1933

It wasn't by accident that the Gettysburg address was so short. The laws of prose writing are as immutable as thoes of flight, of mathematics, of physics. -to Maxwell Perkins 1945. 

As the contract only mentions excisions it is understood of course that no alternations of words shall be amde without my approval. This protects you as much as it does me as the stories are written so tight and os hard that the alteration of a word can throw an entire story out of key. - to Horace Liveright. 1925

True mysticism shoudl not be confused with incompetence in writing which seeks to mystify where there is no mystery but is relaly only the necessity to fake to cover lack of knowledge or the inability to state clearly. Mysticism implies a mysetry and there are many mysteries; but incompetence is not one of them; nor is overwritten journalism made literature by the injection of a false epic quality. Remember this too: all bad writers are in love with the epic. - Death in the Afternoon. 

I can write like Tolstoi and make the book seem larger, wiser, and all the rest of it. But then I remeber that was what I always skipped in Tolstoi….I don't like to write like God. It is only becuase you never do it though, that the critics think you can't do it. -to Maxwell Perkins 1940

Try and write straight English; never using slang except in Dialogue and then only when unavoidable. because all slang goes sour in a short time. I only use swear words, for example, that have lasted at least a thousand years for fear of getting stuff that will be simply timely and then go sour. - to Carol Hemingway 1929

INTERVEIWER: When you are writing, do you ever find yourself influenced by what you're reading at the time? HEMIGNWAY: Not since Joyce was writing *Ulysses*. His was not a direct influence. but in thoes days when words we knew were barred to us, and we had to fight for a single wrod, the influence of his work was what changed everything, and made it possible for us to break away from restrictions. -George Plimpton Interview

I think you should learn about writing from everybody who has everwritten that has anything to teach you. -to F. Scott Fitzgerald. 1925

Mice: What books shoudl a writer have to read? / Y.C.: He should have read everything so he knows what he has to beat. /… Mice: What do you mean "has to beat"? /Y.C.: Listen. There is no use writing anything that has been written before unless you can beat it. What a writer in our time has to do is write what hasn't been written before or beat dead  men at what ehy have done. The only way he can tell how he is going is to compete with dead men…. /Mice: But reading all the good writers might discourage you. /Y.C.: Then you ought to be discouraged. - Byline

"I've been wondering about Dostoyevsky," I said. "How can a man write so badly, so unbelievably badly, and make you feel so deeply?" - A moveable feast. 

"Tell me first what are the things, the acutal, concrete things that harm a writer?"…."Politics, women, drink, money, ambition. And the lack of politics, women, drink, money and ambition," I said profoundly.- Green Hills of Africa p28

This letter is sloppy and full of mistakes but is written in a hurry and is correspnondence not an attemp at prose. 

Please forgive the long stupid letters….I write them instead of stories adn they are a luxury that igves me pleasure and I hope they give you some too. -to Bernard Berenson

Mice: That isn't the way they teach you to write in college. Y.C.: I don't know about that. I never went to colelge. If any sonofabitch could write he wouldn't ahve to teach writing in college. -Byline

Most live writers do not exist. Their fame is created by critics who always need a genius of the season, someone they understand completely and feel safe in praising, but hwen those fabricated geniuses are dead they will not exist. - Byline

You must be prepreaed to work always without applause. When you are excited about something is when the first draft is done. but no one can see it until you ahve gone over it again and again until you have communicated the motion, the sights and the sounds to the reader, and by the time you have completed this the words, sometimes, will not make sense to you as you read them, so many times hav eyou re-read the. By the time the book comes out you will have started something else and it is all behind you and you do not want to hear about it……. -Byline
